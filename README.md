# Devops--General-interview-Q

### 1. As a DevOps Engineer, how do you work on assigned tasks?
As a DevOps Engineer, I follow a structured approach:
1. **Understand the Requirement**: I first clarify the task by reviewing tickets, documentation, or discussing with developers, QA, or product teams.
2. **Plan the Approach**: I break down the task, identify tools or automation needed, and assess any risks or dependencies.
3. **Work in Iterations**: I start with infrastructure as code (like Terraform or CloudFormation), scripting, or CI/CD pipeline changes. I test in a **non-prod environment** first.
4. **Collaboration**: I keep stakeholders updated via stand-ups or Slack, and collaborate through Git (branches, PRs) for transparency.
5. **Validate & Automate**: I validate the solution using test cases, monitoring, or dry runs, and aim to automate the process where possible.
6. **Deploy & Document**: Once verified, I deploy through CI/CD, and document the changes for future reference.
